Are you feed up with 27th (I-27) ? 
Are you concerned about what 27th will look like in  five years? 

As the city prepares to plan for the next five years and prepares and approves the budget for 2016 lets not let them forget about 27th street:

* Stop sign at Missouri
* Crosswalk light for Naismith Trail
* Crossing island at the Belle Haven cross walk
* Alabama crosswalks repainted
* Reduced speed limit 
* Roundabout
* Speed Humps
* Sidewalk connectivity
 
And that's just some of the ideas that our residents have! 

Come! Be a part of the discussion and don't let the our elected officials forget to Fund 27th!!!
