  <h2>Traffic on 27th street</h2>
<p>
A request for traffic calming from the Indian Hills Neighborhood Association
was brought before the Traffic Safety Commission and approved in December 2012
and brought before and approved by the City Commission January 2013. This took
place almost one year before the beginning of the South Lawrence Traffic Way
project (Nov 2013) and almost 2 years before the 31st Street closure and the
simultaneous 23rd Street heavy construction. These projects and road closures
diverted a significant amount of through traffic down 27th Street, our
residential neighborhoods. 

<p>
Despite the fact that concerns were voiced by the members of the Indian Hills
Neighborhood Association and agreed upon by both the Traffic Safety Commission
and the Lawrence City Commission there was no action taken by the City to
allocate funds for traffic calming prior to other projects that magnified the
already existing and agreed upon safety concerns. 

<p>
The Indian Hills Neighborhood is home to Naismith Park, as well as a school
crossing and school zone for Broken Arrow Elementary and South Middle School.
The failure to apply the previously agreed upon traffic calming measures and
the increase in traffic due to local construction has created an unsafe
environment for our residentâ€™s children and families. 

<p>
We request that the city review and approve funding of projects for 2016 that
funding be allocated the already approved traffic calming measures for 27th
Street, ensuring the safety of our residents.
 <p>

We also ask the city that as it develops a new 5 Year Plan for the City that they take
the opportunity to identify any potential increase to 27th Street traffic and
Louisiana Street traffic and how the safety of the neighborhood residents will
be ensured. Included in this discussion should be recognition of the parks and
schools that families and children enjoy through the use of 27th Street and
Louisiana. 
<p>

Our neighborhood has been challenged by this traffic. Residents feel overlooked
and neglected and it is the responsibility of the city Commission to ensure that
there are legitimate actions taken to repair the damage that has been done and
to fulfill the previously agreed upon measures.
